# Food-App

- I developed a dynamic food app using ReactJS with Tailwind CSS for styling, incorporating live data from the Swiggy
  API. Redux toolkit is used for state management. The application features real-time information on various restaurants, each showcasing recommended dishes.
  Users can effortlessly add or remove items from their carts, and additional functionalities include food search, and
  sorting by ratings. For a more in-depth exploration of my coding projects and contributions
